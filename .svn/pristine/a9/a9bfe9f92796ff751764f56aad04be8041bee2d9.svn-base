		 for useful information has become more difficult.
		 Focused crawler intends to explore the Web conform to a
		 specific topic. This paper discusses the problems
		 caused by local searching algorithms. Crawler can be
		 trapped within a limited Web community and overlook
		 suitable Web pages outside its track. A genetic
		 algorithm as a global searching algorithm is modified
		 to address the problems. The genetic algorithm is used
		 to optimize Web crawling and to select more suitable
		 Web pages to be fetched by the crawler. Several
		 evaluation experiments are conducted to examine the
		 effectiveness of the approach. The crawler delivers
		 collections consist of 3396 Web pages from 5390 links
		 which had been visited, or filtering rate of
		 Roulette-Wheel selection at 63% and precision level at
		 93% in 5 different categories. The result showed that
		 the utilization of genetic algorithm had empowered
		 focused crawler to traverse the Web comprehensively,
		 despite it relatively small collections. Furthermore,
		 it brought up a great potential for building an
		 exemplary collections compared to traditional focused
		 crawling methods.{\par}",

  abstract =	 {This work addresses issues related to the design and
                  implementation of focused crawlers. Several variants
                  of state-of-the-art crawlers relying on web page
                  content and link information for estimating the
                  relevance of web pages to a given topic are
                  proposed. Particular emphasis is given to crawlers
                  capable of learning not only the content of relevant
                  pages (as classic crawlers do) but also paths
                  leading to relevant pages. A novel learning crawler
                  inspired by a previously proposed Hidden Markov
                  Model {(HMM)} crawler is described as well. The
                  crawlers have been implemented using the same
                  baseline implementation (only the priority
                  assignment function differs in each crawler)
                  providing an unbiased evaluation framework for a
                  comparative analysis of their performance. All
                  crawlers achieve their maximum performance when a
                  combination of web page content and (link) anchor
                  text is used for assigning download priorities to
                  web pages. Furthermore, the new {HMM} crawler
                  improved the performance of the original {HMM}
                  crawler and also outperforms classic focused
                  crawlers in searching for specialized topics.},

Shorthand mnemonics such as ``wiki'' or ``blog'' are often embedded in a URL to convey its functional purpose or genre. Other mnemonics have evolved from use (e.g., a Wordpress particle is strongly suggestive of blogs). Can we leverage from this predictive power to induce the genre of a document from the representation of a URL? This paper presents a methodology for webpage genre classification from URLs which, to our knowledge, has not been previously attempted. Experiments using machine learning techniques to evaluate this claim show promising results and a novel algorithm for character n-gram decomposition is provided. Such a capability could be useful to improve personalized search results, disambiguate content, efficiently crawl the Web in search of relevant documents, and construct behavioral profiles from clickstream data without parsing the entire document.}

		 accessible repositories of human knowledge. The
		 traditional search engines index only surface Web whose
		 pages are easily found. The focus has now been moved to
		 invisible Web or hidden Web, which consists of a large
		 warehouse of useful data such as images, sounds,
		 presentations and many other types of media. To use
		 such data, there is a need for specialized technique to
		 locate those sites as we do with search engines. This
		 paper focuses on an effective design of a Hidden Web
		 Crawler that can automatically discover pages from the
		 Hidden Web by employing multi- agent Web mining system.
		 A framework for deep web with genetic algorithm is used
		 to discover the resource discovery problem and the
		 results show the improvement in the crawling strategy
		 and harvest rate.",

  abstract = {Clustering Search (*CS) has been proposed as a generic way of combining search metaheuristics with clustering to detect promising search areas before applying local search procedures. The clustering process may keep representative solutions associated with different search subspaces. In this paper, new approaches are proposed, based on *CS, as an Artificial Bee Colony-based one, which detects promising food sources alike *CS approaches. The other new *CS approach is based on Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm. The DE is just a CS component (the evolutionary algorithm), different from ABC-based approach, called Artificial Bee Clustering Search (ABCS). ABCS tries to find promising solutions using some concepts from CS. The proposed hybrid algorithms, performing a Hooke and Jeeves-based local, are compared to another hybrid approaches, exploring an elitist criteria to apply local search. The experiments show that the proposed ABCS and Differential Evolutionary Clustering Search (DECS) are competitive for the majority continuous optimization functions benckmarks selected in this paper.},

  abstract =	 {This work addresses issues related to the design and
                  implementation of focused crawlers. Several variants
                  of state-of-the-art crawlers relying on web page
                  content and link information for estimating the
                  relevance of web pages to a given topic are
                  proposed. Particular emphasis is given to crawlers
                  capable of learning not only the content of relevant
                  pages (as classic crawlers do) but also paths
                  leading to relevant pages. A novel learning crawler
                  inspired by a previously proposed Hidden Markov
                  Model {(HMM)} crawler is described as well. The
                  crawlers have been implemented using the same
                  baseline implementation (only the priority
                  assignment function differs in each crawler)
                  providing an unbiased evaluation framework for a
                  comparative analysis of their performance. All
                  crawlers achieve their maximum performance when a
                  combination of web page content and (link) anchor
                  text is used for assigning download priorities to
                  web pages. Furthermore, the new {HMM} crawler
                  improved the performance of the original {HMM}
                  crawler and also outperforms classic focused
                  crawlers in searching for specialized topics.},

	abstract = {The importance of URLs in the representation of a document cannot be overstated. Shorthand mnemonics such as ``wiki'' or ``blog'' are often embedded in a URL to convey its functional purpose or genre. Other mnemonics have evolved from use (e.g., a Wordpress particle is strongly suggestive of blogs). Can we leverage from this predictive power to induce the genre of a document from the representation of a URL? This paper presents a methodology for webpage genre classification from URLs which, to our knowledge, has not been previously attempted. Experiments using machine learning techniques to evaluate this claim show promising results and a novel algorithm for character n-gram decomposition is provided. Such a capability could be useful to improve personalized search results, disambiguate content, efficiently crawl the Web in search of relevant documents, and construct behavioral profiles from clickstream data without parsing the entire document.}
